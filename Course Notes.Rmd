title: "Machine Learning Course Notes and Excercises"
output: html_notebook
---

This **Notebook** is my place for notes and practical applications for the course on [Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview) by [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremenko), later I will produce another one with excercises from the CETYS project by the [group](https://da4ih.github.io) I am a member of.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


## Data Preprocessing

### Importing the dataset
To import the data set one has to do the following:  

* Find the directory where the dataset is located at.
* Make that directory the "working directory".
```{r}
setwd("D:/Dropbox/Clases/Udemy/Machine Learning A-Z/machinelearning/Part 1 - Data Preprocessing/Section 2 -------------------- Part 1 - Data Preprocessing --------------------")

dataset = read.csv('Data.csv')

dataset
```


It is important to remember that in **R** indexing starts at 1 instead of 0, which is the case in **Python**.

### Dealing With Missing Data

When facing missing data in entries one could think of 2 approaches up till now:

1. Delete all entries with missing data. (**This is not cool and very very dangerous**, cause it could eliminate data that could influence the end result).
1. Calculate the ***mean*** according of all the data in the same variable from the other entries and replace the missing value.
    + This is the approach that will be used in this analysis.

#### Dealing with the **Age** Column
```{r}
dataset$Age = ifelse(is.na(dataset$Age),
                     ave(dataset$Age, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                     dataset$Age)
dataset
```

### Dealing with the **Salary** Column

```{r}
dataset$Salary = ifelse(is.na(dataset$Salary),
                     ave(dataset$Salary, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                     dataset$Salary)
dataset
```

Function **`ifelse`** takes three arguments:  

1. Condition.
2. Value wanted to be inputed if the condition is true.
3. Value wanted to be inputed if the condition is false.
