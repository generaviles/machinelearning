This **Notebook** is my place for notes and practical applications for the course on [Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview) by [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremenko), later I will produce another one with excercises from the CETYS project by the [group](https://da4ih.github.io) I am a member of.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


## Data Preprocessing

### Importing the dataset
To import the data set one has to do the following:  

* Find the directory where the dataset is located at.
* Make that directory the "working directory".
```{r}
setwd("D:/Dropbox/Clases/Udemy/Machine Learning A-Z/machinelearning/Part 1 - Data Preprocessing/Section 2 -------------------- Part 1 - Data Preprocessing --------------------")

dataset = read.csv('Data.csv')

dataset
```


It is important to remember that in **R** indexing starts at 1 instead of 0, which is the case in **Python**.

### Dealing With Missing Data

When facing missing data in entries one could think of 2 approaches up till now:

1. Delete all entries with missing data. (**This is not cool and very very dangerous**, cause it could eliminate data that could influence the end result).
1. Calculate the ***mean*** according of all the data in the same variable from the other entries and replace the missing value.
    + This is the approach that will be used in this analysis.

#### Dealing with the **Age** Column
```{r}
dataset$Age = ifelse(is.na(dataset$Age),
                     ave(dataset$Age, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                     dataset$Age)
dataset
```

#### Dealing with the **Salary** Column

```{r}
dataset$Salary = ifelse(is.na(dataset$Salary),
                     ave(dataset$Salary, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                     dataset$Salary)
dataset
```

Function **`ifelse`** takes three arguments:  

1. Condition.
2. Value wanted to be inputed if the condition is true.
3. Value wanted to be inputed if the condition is false.

### Categorical Variables

Values that are reported with letters or in numbers not keeping itÂ´s aritmethical value and relationships are called **categorical**, because they indicate *categories*. This type of data cannot be used *"as is"* in analysis with numerical values because it would generate errors. In order to be able to run analisys of these variables we have to ***encode*** them, which means to assign a numerical value to each of the categories.

**This is achieved in R by factoring the values of the variables with categorical data**

  - **Country Variable**
```{r}
dataset$Country = factor(dataset$Country,
                         levels = c('France','Spain','Germany'),
                         labels = c(1, 2, 3))
dataset
```

  - **Purchased Variable**

```{r}
dataset$Purchased = factor(dataset$Purchased,
                         levels = c('No','Yes'),
                         labels = c(0, 1))
dataset
```

### Splitting Dataset into Training and Test Set

For this process it is important to install and load `caTools`. `r library(caTools)`

```{r}
set.seed(123)
split = sample.split(dataset$Purchased, SplitRatio = 0.8)
```

This will generate a vector with results indicating either `True` or `False`, if true then it means that it has been chosen to be part of the *training* set, if false it means it has been chosen to be part of the *test* set.

Now the training and test sets have to be separated so we can work on both independently, the following code get's this acomplished:

```{r}
training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE)

```
  
You can look at the **training_set** here:
```{r}
training_set
```

And the **test_set** here:
```{r}
test_set

```

### Feature Scaling

I have to add the concetps of Eucledian Distance, Normalization and Standardization.

```{r}
training_set[, 2:3] = scale(training_set[, 2:3])
test_set[, 2:3] = scale(test_set[, 2:3])
```

It is important to notice that only columns 2 and 3 were included in the feature scaling process because these are the only variables containing numerical values.

You can see an example of the result of the process in the `test_set`:
```{r}
test_set
```
