##Quick Intro
I am going to try to standardize the analysis and force myself to a methodology.<br \> Will be trying to follow these points:

  1. Set the working directory to where the data is.
  1. Data preprocessing.
    - Choosing the right set of variables (in this case *rating* of a cereal and *sugar* content).
    - Making sure there are no missing values.
    - Cheking the type of values contained in the variables.
    - Splitting dataset into training and test data sets.
  1. Fitting SLR to *training set*.
  1. Predicting *test set* results.
  1. Visualizing *training set* results.
