PCA seeks to explain the correlation structure of a set of predictor variables using a smaller set of linear combinations (components) of these variables.


## Implementation in R

To run a PCA in R it is important to have the packages `caret` and `e1071` installed.

### Creating the Variable PCA

It will later be used to transform original dataset with the new extracted features.
```{r}
library(caret)
library(e1071)
pca <- preProcess()
```
