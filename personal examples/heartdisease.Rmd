This Notebook will be a repository of my initial excercises used to fully comprehend and internalized the concepts learned in the course.

I am going to be working with the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

## Data Preprocesing

### Importing the Dataset

The following code renders a table with the correct *headers* according to the remote repository:
```{r}
setwd("D:/Dropbox/Clases/Udemy/Machine Learning A-Z/machinelearning/personal examples")

heartdata = read.table("processedva.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ",")

colnames(heartdata) <- c("age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "num")

head(heartdata)
```
### Adjusting the Dataset
#### Getting rid of columns where almost everything is missing
At plain sight one notices that column 12 and 13 contain mostly missing values. They will be of no use in the analysis, so we will get rid of them to be able to continue with the processing.

```{r}
heartdata <- heartdata[,-12,-13]
head(heartdata)
```

#### Dealing with missing values
